# Handover — v2 deployment, 5 September 2026

Supersedes `HANDOVERSEBASTIAN.md`, which is stale in four measurable ways
recorded below. Written after deploying `v2.splashz.xyz` for the MUBA Hack
demo.

Protocol unchanged: **Move changes are confirmed by the CTO. No
self-approval.** No Move source was changed in this work — `splash_core` was
published as-is.

---

## The one-paragraph version

`v2.splashz.xyz` is live on Node 24, Postgres 14 on-box, Sui 1.77.2, with
`splash_core` published to testnet and `splash_custody` deliberately absent.
zkLogin is on. Every decision the previous handover asked for is now answered
except one, and every outage risk it named is closed. 304 Node tests and 107
Move tests are green. Two real bugs were found and fixed that would each have
broken the demo. **One thing is blocked and needs you: the git remote
`sky9484/splashAN` now returns 404, so six commits cannot be pushed.**

---

## Status of everything the previous handover asked for

Each row was verified by running or reading it on the box, not by trusting
either document.

| # | It asked for | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Decide about the lockfiles | **Resolved** | `Move.lock` is already `version = 4` pinned to `06734f6f` — the 1.77.2 framework. The publish changed only quote style (`'` → `"`), same rev, same digests. The handover's claim that it pins 1.59.1/`494fa6ed` is out of date. |
| D2 | Confirm Phase 6 scope | **Already built** | All seven sub-items are in the source; see the audit below. |
| D3 | Decide the empty `[dependencies]` | **STILL OPEN** | Still empty, deliberately. See "What still needs you". |
| R1 | Seal config file + env must land together | **Closed** | `config/seal.production.json` committed; none of the seven moved keys is set on the host. |
| R2 | Remove `CUSTOMER_EMAIL` / `CUSTOMER_PASSWORD` | **Closed** | Neither is present in `.env.local`. Boot is clean. |
| R3 | Migrations `0004`/`0005` never run on real Postgres | **Closed** | Both applied against real Postgres 14.24. 22 tables. `0004` had no data to move on a fresh database, so its risky path was never exercised — see gaps. |
| — | `PASSKEY_RP_ID` before first enrolment | **Decided** | Set to `v2.splashz.xyz` on the CTO's explicit instruction, with 0 credentials enrolled at the time. |

### Phase 6 audit — all seven items are present

The previous handover says "Phase 6 is blocked on you alone" and "it has not
started". Both are wrong. Verified in `move/splash_core/sources/`:

- `mint_attestation_cap` — **deleted.** It survives only in comments that
  explain the deletion (`cap_registry.move:5`, `business_account.move:336,833`).
- `owners` / `approvers` / `frozen` / `recovery_party` — all present in
  `business_account.move`.
- Revocation that kills in-flight approvals — implemented as cap
  **generations**; a cap from a superseded generation is dead on chain
  (`business_account.move:183-191`). Enforced by `npm run check:generations`.
- 24h velocity cap — `daily_limit.move`, `WINDOW_MS = 86_400_000`.
- `ComplianceCap` subtractive by type — enforced in CI by
  `scripts/check-compliance-subtractive.mjs`.
- The `TreasuryCap` / `AnchorCap` / `ComplianceCap` / `AdminCap` split —
  four separate structs, and the publish created three of them as distinct
  on-chain objects.

**Phase 7 is also in.** Cap generations are described in the source as a
Phase 7 addition, and `break_glass_tests` run green.

### The other three stale claims

| Handover says | Actual |
|---|---|
| 52 Move tests (14 + 22 + 16) | **107** (68 core + 23 meter + 16 custody) |
| 304 tests across eleven Node suites | 304 confirmed — this one is right |
| Committed lock records `compiler-version = "1.59.1"` | Lock is v4 on `06734f6f` |
| `sui move build` on any CLI silently repins the lock | Not observed on 1.77.2. A full `sui move test` across all three packages left the working tree clean. |

## What is deployed

| | |
|---|---|
| URL | https://v2.splashz.xyz (TLS to 2026-12-04, its own cert — v1's was never reissued) |
| Host | `157.230.43.242`, service `splash-an`, port 3005 |
| Node | 24.11.1 at `/opt/node24` (v1 stays on `/usr/bin/node` 22 — deliberately isolated) |
| Database | PostgreSQL 14.24 on-box, role/db `splashan`, 22 tables |
| Sui CLI | 1.77.2 (`51d177ad7d65`); 1.75.1 kept at `/usr/local/bin/sui-1.75.1-backup` |
| `splash_core` | `0xae1fb78a654fde843bcf88836a43aae4d76b6758bd44acb8ee12cc69d60067b7` |
| `splash_custody` | **not published** — regulatory posture, not a gap |
| `splash_meter` | not published — it is a library only custody links against |
| Posture | `NODE_ENV=production` with `USE_MOCK_APIS=true` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true` |
| zkLogin | **on**, Google client `233426498982-…`, project `splashz` |
| v1 | untouched throughout, still `active`, still 200 |

```

`Published.toml` records the same, and is committed.

### Why both `SPLASH_PACKAGE_ID` and `SPLASH_CORE_PACKAGE_ID` are set

They hold the same value, and that is deliberate. `SPLASH_PACKAGE_ID` is
required unconditionally in production. But `custodyPackageIdOrThrow()` falls
back to the legacy id **only when `SPLASH_CORE_PACKAGE_ID` is unset** — so
setting core is what *disables* the fallback and makes batch settlement throw
the licence-named error instead of silently targeting a `settlement` module
that does not exist in `splash_core`.

That error is the demo's best beat: non-custody is enforced by absent
bytecode, not by a flag anyone could flip.

---

## Two bugs found, both would have broken the demo

**1. Seal blocked every payment.** `canUseDemoCrypto()` tested `NODE_ENV`
alone, so a deployment with the demo flags set still demanded a live Seal
committee and refused every payment with *"Seal is read-only: No Seal key
servers configured"* — the same failure v1 hit. `lib/env.ts` already makes the
vendor keys optional under those same flags and calls that "a posture decision
recorded by those flags"; Seal now reads the same signal.

There was a test deliberately pinning the old behaviour. It was **not**
deleted — it was re-pinned behaviourally, which is stronger than the source-text
regex it replaced:

```
canUseDemoCrypto({ NODE_ENV: 'production' })                          === false
canUseDemoCrypto({ NODE_ENV: 'production', USE_MOCK_APIS: 'true' })   === true
```

A real deployment that declares no demo posture still gets real crypto and
still fails closed. **This is a security-posture change and wants your explicit
sign-off. It must be reverted before any real-money deployment.**

**2. zkLogin could never have worked.** `fetchEpochInfo()` looked for
`getLatestSuiSystemState` — the retired JSON-RPC name. `lib/sui.ts` builds a
`SuiGrpcClient`, which calls it `core.getCurrentSystemState` and returns a
different shape (fields under a `systemState` envelope, `epochDurationMs` moved
into `parameters`, every scalar a string). The lookup never found a function,
so every sign-in would have died with *"The Sui epoch could not be read"*
before the user reached Google. Found by dry-running the enable script with a
placeholder client id rather than trusting it.

Worth noting the code failed *correctly*: it returned null rather than
inventing an epoch, which is why the failure was a clean 503 and not a proof
the network would silently reject.

## The six commits (unpushed — see blocker)

```
032eb80 feat: add privacy policy and terms of service
afd7498 fix(zklogin): read the epoch from the gRPC client
d3f0ac0 chore(move): record the splash_core testnet publish
40f3fed config: add the production Seal config file
7bc784f fix(seal): let the demo flags govern demo crypto
bf4229d chore: drop the stray node dependency
```

`bf4229d` is worth reading: `package.json` declared `engines.node >=24.11 <25`
while `dependencies` pulled `node ^26.3.0`. npm installs that as
`node_modules/.bin/node` and prepends it to PATH, so every `npm run` executed on
Node 26 while `which node` reported 24. `doctor` was reporting a version nobody
could locate.

---

## BLOCKED — needs you

**`https://github.com/sky9484/splashAN` returns 404.** It was public this
morning (the clone at `4ac05c7` succeeded); it has since been made private,
renamed, or deleted. Unauthenticated `curl` and an authenticated `gh` as
`belulok` both get 404, so this is not a local credential problem.

The six commits exist **only on the droplet**. A full bundle of the history is
backed up at `~/splash-backups/splashAN-20260905-2208.bundle` on the CTO's Mac
(verified: complete history, `main` at `032eb80`).

To unblock, one of:

1. Ask sky9484 to restore the repo, or to grant access if it went private.
2. Name a different remote to push to — and say whether it should be private.
3. Restore from the bundle anywhere: `git clone splashAN-*.bundle splashAN`

Nothing was pushed and no new repository was created, because publishing a
fintech codebase is not a decision to make on someone's behalf.

---

## What still needs you

**1. `splash_core/Move.toml` has an empty `[dependencies]` (D3, still open).**
The absence of *third-party* dependencies is deliberate and well argued in the
file — Cetus was drained through a third-party math library, and the defence is
not auditing the dependency but not having one. That reasoning is sound and is
not what is in question. The open point is that with `[dependencies]` empty,
the **Sui framework** itself is pinned only by `Move.lock`. Today that lock is
v4 on `06734f6f`, which matches the toolchain the 107 tests ran against, so the
risk is much smaller than when the handover was written. Pinning explicitly in
the manifest would close it entirely; leaving it means the lock stays the single
source of truth. Either is defensible.

**2. Sign off (or reject) the `canUseDemoCrypto` change** described above.

**3. Confirm the legal pages.** `/privacy-policy` and `/terms-of-service` exist
because the Google consent screen links to them. They are `noindex` until
`LEGAL_APPROVED=true`. They are drafts and have not been reviewed by counsel.
They assert: governing law Malaysia; liability capped at the greater of three
months of fees or USD 100; contacts `privacy@` / `legal@` / `security@`
`splashz.xyz` — **those mailboxes must actually receive mail.**

**4. Decide `USDC_TYPE`.** Left empty. Production rejects the `0x2::sui::SUI`
stand-in, and it is only *required* when settlement is live, which it is not
under the demo flags. Needs a real coin type before any live settlement.

---

## Known gaps — stated rather than buried

- **The Google round trip has never been exercised by a human.** Everything up
  to it is verified: the endpoint returns `enabled:true` with a live epoch and
  `maxEpoch`. The browser hop is the one thing no automated check covers.
  If the consent screen is still in **Testing**, only listed test users can sign
  in; everyone else gets `Error 403: access_denied`.
- **Migration `0004` moved no data**, because the database was fresh. Its
  hand-written data-migration path is therefore still unexercised. It will
  matter the first time this runs against a database that already has users.
- **No real Seal committee.** `seal.production.json` is committed unconfigured
  (empty `servers[]`, which the loader reports as unconfigured rather than an
  error). Fine under demo posture; not fine for production.
- **`splash_meter` is unpublished.** Nothing references it at runtime, so this
  is not currently a gap — but batch settlement will need it alongside custody.
- **Vendor keys are all empty** (Enoki, Walrus, PDAX, Stripe, Airwallex).
  Intentional: `vendorsLive` is false under the demo flags.
- **`sudo` for the `splash` user** is limited to three
  `systemctl … splash-an` verbs via `/etc/sudoers.d/splash-an`.

## Operating it

```bash
# health
curl -s https://v2.splashz.xyz/api/auth/zklogin/params
ssh splash@157.230.43.242 'sudo systemctl status splash-an'
ssh splash@157.230.43.242 'journalctl -u splash-an -n 50 --no-pager'

# full gate (from /home/splash/splashAN, PATH=/opt/node24/bin:$PATH)
npm run doctor        # 0 failures expected
npm run lint          # chains the six check:* invariants
npm run build

# turn zkLogin off in ~10s
ssh splash@157.230.43.242 'cd ~/splashAN && sed -i s/^FEATURE_ZKLOGIN=.*/FEATURE_ZKLOGIN=false/ .env.local && sudo systemctl restart splash-an'
# and on
ssh splash@157.230.43.242 './enable-zklogin.sh <GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>'
```

Secrets live on the box, never in the repo and never in chat:

```
~/.secrets/database_url        ~/.secrets/v2_admin_password
~/.secrets/v2_zklogin_salt     ~/.secrets/env.local.bak.*
```

`ZKLOGIN_USER_SALT` feeds address derivation — **losing it changes every
derived address.** The Google client secret is at `~/.splash-secrets/` on the
CTO's Mac, moved out of the repo where it had been left untracked but
un-ignored; `client_secret_*.json` is now in `.gitignore`. The secret is not
needed by this flow (`response_type=id_token`), only the public client id.

## Test baseline

```
Node   304 / 304   (seal 10, env 12, health 7, auth 93, money 17,
                    db 14, funding 12, batch 4, explorer 6, oxwal 129)
Move   107 / 107   (core 68, meter 23, custody 16)
doctor 0 failures  ·  lint clean  ·  tsc --noEmit clean
```

A full `sui move test` across all three packages leaves the working tree
clean — no lockfile repin on 1.77.2.
