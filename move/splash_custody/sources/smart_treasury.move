/// SmartTreasury — generic, AdminCap-gated treasury that actually holds funds.
///
/// Replaces the Phase 1 scaffold which (a) accepted `Coin<SUI>` while claiming
/// to hold USDC, (b) only tracked u64 counters with no on-chain backing, and
/// (c) called `coin::destroy_zero` on a non-zero coin and always aborted.
///
/// Findings addressed (see SECURITY.md):
///   - C-01: `add_usdc` always aborts
///   - C-02: treasury holds no real value
///   - M-04: shared object per rebalance → replaced with event
///   - M-05: magic abort codes → named constants
///
/// Design:
///   * `SmartTreasury<phantom T>` holds a real `Balance<T>` (USDC, USDT, or
///     any coin type chosen at create time).
///   * Deposits move the coin into the balance via `balance::join`.
///   * Withdrawals are AdminCap-gated and emit `TreasuryWithdrawn`.
///   * All state changes emit events — no shared objects per call.
