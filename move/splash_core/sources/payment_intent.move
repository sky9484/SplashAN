/// Consume a settlement receipt. THE ONLY function that destroys a
/// `SettleReceipt`, and it may only be called from `audit_anchor`.
///
/// `SettleReceipt` is a hot potato — no `drop`, no `store`, no `key` — so a PTB
/// that produces one must consume it here or abort. That already guaranteed
/// "every settlement is anchored *or the transaction fails*". What it did NOT
/// guarantee was WHO does the anchoring: `public(package)` meant any future
/// module in this package could unpack a receipt and discard the fields without
/// ever emitting an anchor event, silently breaking the audit trail.
///
/// The witness closes that. `audit_anchor::AnchorWitness` can only be
/// constructed inside `audit_anchor` (Move permits struct construction only in
/// the defining module), so holding one proves the caller IS the anchoring path.
///
/// Why the witness is generic + checked at runtime rather than named directly:
/// `audit_anchor` already depends on `payment_intent`, and Move forbids circular
/// module dependencies, so this module cannot import `AnchorWitness` by name.
/// Binding on the module identity of the witness type achieves the same
/// restriction — the assert cannot be satisfied by any type outside
/// `audit_anchor`, because no other module can construct one.
