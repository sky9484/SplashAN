/// AuditAnchor — immutable on-chain anchoring of off-chain audit content.
///
/// Replaces the Phase 1 scaffold which (a) had no caller authorization so
/// anyone could pollute the audit trail with junk anchors (M-01) and (b)
/// shipped a tautological `verify_anchor` function that compared a hash
/// against itself (M-02).
///
/// Design:
///   * Anchors are AttestationCap-gated. Off-chain indexers can trust that any
///     `AuditAnchor` shared object in the package came from the protocol.
///   * Each anchor records the anchorer + business account it relates to
///     so tenant-level audit trails are filterable.
///   * `verify_anchor` now takes an externally-supplied `expected_hash`
///     and a Walrus blob ID and emits a `VerificationChecked` event so
///     the verification leaves a trace (instead of being a no-op view).
