 * with no caller, so the only way to give a new account access was to open a
 * SQL client. A control nobody can operate gets worked around.
 *
 * This is the operator surface for it. It does not introduce a second grant
 * path: it calls the same `grantMembership` the tests assert against, so there
 * is still exactly one function that can create a membership.
