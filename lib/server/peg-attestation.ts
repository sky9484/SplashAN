/**
 * What the settlement PTB is allowed to write into `PegState`.
 *
 * Audit finding (high): every settlement PTB called
 *
 *     peg_monitor::update_peg(state, cap, SPLASH_PEG_USDC_DEVIATION_PPM ?? '0',
 *                                         SPLASH_PEG_USDT_DEVIATION_PPM ?? '0', clock)
 *
 * as its FIRST command, and `settle_payment` — which calls `assert_pegged` —
 * as its second. The breaker therefore read a perfect 0-ppm peg that the very
 * same transaction had just written, one instruction earlier. `assert_pegged`
 * could not fail. The on-chain peg circuit breaker, the control that exists so
 * that funds cannot leave on a broken peg even when the off-chain layer is
 * bypassed, was inert in every deployment.
 *
 * Two things were wrong and both are fixed here:
 *
 *  1. The pushed value was a CONSTANT (env, defaulting to `0`), not a
 *     measurement. A settlement may only attest a reading it actually took.
 *  2. `pythAdapter` falls back to `mockPrice()` — an exact $1.00, `source:
 *     'mock'` — on any Hermes error, so even "measured" could mean fabricated.
 *     A fabricated reading is never pushed.
 *
 * When no live reading is available the PTB simply omits `update_peg`. That is
 * the fail-closed direction: `PegState` goes stale and `assert_pegged` aborts
 * with 302 `E_PEG_STALE` rather than green-lighting a settlement against a peg
 * nobody checked.
