/**
 * Exact money arithmetic. Integer minor units, no float anywhere.
 *
 * `check:copy` warned on seventeen sites doing float math on money and called
 * it "the debt mainnet cannot carry". This is what pays it down.
 *
 * The problem is not that floats are imprecise in the abstract. It is that
 * `parseFloat('0.1')` is already not 0.1 — it is 0.1000000000000000055511…,
 * the nearest double. Add a hundred of them and you get 9.99999999999998, so
 * a batch of a hundred ten-cent payouts reconciles one cent short against a
 * ledger that did the same sum in integers. Nothing warns you; the number is
 * simply wrong, and it is wrong differently depending on the order the rows
 * arrived in.
 *
 * So: a money amount is a `bigint` count of minor units, and its decimals are
 * carried alongside it. A rate is a scaled integer, so amount × rate is
 * integer arithmetic that happens to have a decimal point in the middle.
 *
 * Rounding is always an argument. There is no default, because there is no
 * safe one: rounding a payout down and a fee up are both defensible, and both
 * are wrong in the other direction. A caller that has not thought about it
 * should be made to.
