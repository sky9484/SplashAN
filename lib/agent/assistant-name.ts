/**
 * Letting someone rename the assistant.
 *
 * ─── Why this is stored in MemWal and not a settings column ─────────────────
 *
 * MemWal is free-text semantic memory: `rememberFact(text)` and
 * `recallMemories(query)`. There is no key/value get and set, and the namespace
 * is process-wide rather than per user — so a name stored there is recalled by
 * SEARCHING for it, and a search can return somebody else's.
 *
 * That is a real constraint and it shapes what is safe to put there. A
 * preferred name is: cosmetic, non-authoritative, and harmless to get wrong —
 * the worst outcome is the assistant answering to the wrong nickname. Nothing
 * that decides access, money or identity belongs in a store with those
 * properties, and none of it is here.
 *
 * The fact is written with the org id inside the sentence so recall can be
 * filtered rather than trusted, and the read is anchored to the same org.
