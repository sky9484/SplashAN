/**
 * DeepBook venue whitelist helpers (audit S-12).
 *
 * `peg_monitor::assert_deepbook_liquidity` measures depth and slippage on a
 * `Pool` object the CALLER supplies. DeepBook pools are permissionlessly
 * creatable, so without a whitelist the guard proves nothing: stand up a pool,
 * seed it with your own liquidity, and every assert passes. `ComplianceConfig`
 * now carries `allowed_deepbook_pools` and the guard aborts with 353 on anything
 * else.
 *
 * These helpers are pure so they can be unit-tested without a chain: parsing the
 * whitelist off a `VecSet<ID>` and comparing it against `DEEPBOOK_POOL_ID` is
 * exactly where an off-by-one-encoding bug would silently disable the check.
