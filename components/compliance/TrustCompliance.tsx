          Every settlement produces a tamper-proof, Seal-encrypted audit record stored on Walrus and
          anchored on Sui, retained for seven years. Records are private by default; regulators and
          auditors can be granted visibility on authorization — decryption is a permissioned act, not
          a data request. This aligns with Sui&apos;s regulator-visible confidential-transfer
          direction: confidential to the public, verifiable to the people who are supposed to verify.
