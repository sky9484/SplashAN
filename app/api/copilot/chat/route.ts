/**
 * 0xWal — AI Copilot chat endpoint (streaming, Server-Sent Events).
 *
 * Per turn:
 *   1. Recall relevant memories from MemWal (Walrus Memory).
 *   2. Stream a reply — Claude when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set (native token
 *      streaming), otherwise a grounded domain responder streamed word-by-word
 *      so the chat feels alive either way.
 *   3. Remember the user's message in MemWal (fire-and-forget).
 *
 * SSE events (one JSON object per `data:` frame):
 *   { type: 'meta',  memories, memoryCount, memwalEnabled, source }
 *   { type: 'delta', text }
 *   { type: 'done' }
 *
 * Degrades gracefully — if MemWal/Claude are unavailable it still streams a
 * useful grounded answer, so the chat UI never breaks.
