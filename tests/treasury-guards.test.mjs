/**
 * The one money route nothing governed.
 *
 * `POST /api/treasury` moved customer principal into and out of a yield-bearing
 * treasury with no second factor, no per-transfer or daily ceiling, no
 * compliance pause check and no approval. Every ceiling an operator configured
 * in Settings simply did not apply to it.
 *
 * And it operated on a SHARED ledger: `getLedger(userId)` returned
 * `ledgers.get(userId) ?? seedDemo()`, and `seedDemo()` only ever writes the
 * `demo-business` key — so every org fell through to the demo ledger and every
 * mutation ran against `ledger.userId`, which was always `'demo-business'`.
 * One tenant could move or withdraw another tenant's principal.
