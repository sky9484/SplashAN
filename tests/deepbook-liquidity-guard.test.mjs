/**
 * Regression guard for the S-07 fix in
 * `peg_monitor::assert_deepbook_liquidity` (move/sources/peg_monitor.move).
 *
 * `sui move test` cannot run in this repo — the pinned DeepBook dependency
 * ships test files that fail to compile against the current toolchain
 * (unbound `destroy` in deepbook's own vault_tests.move), which aborts the
 * whole test build before our modules are reached. So the arithmetic the fix
 * depends on is pinned here instead, using REAL numbers measured against the
 * live testnet SUI/DBUSDC pool (0x1c19362c…) on 2026-08-09:
 *
 *   mid_price                     0.691
 *   get_quote_quantity_out_input_fee(1.3 SUI)
 *     -> remaining_base           0.0985   (lot-size dust + input-side taker fee)
 *     -> quote_out                0.8256
 *
 * Two bugs made every batch unsettleable:
 *   1. the guard required `remaining_base == 0`, which a lot-quantized book
 *      can never return;
 *   2. slippage was priced against the REQUESTED quantity rather than the
 *      FILLED quantity, charging the unfilled dust as if it executed at zero.
