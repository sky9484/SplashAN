# Splash Protocol — Security Audit & Monitoring Report

**Scope**: All Move modules under `move/sources/` (8 modules)
**Methodology**: OtterSec-style review — capability access control, resource handling, integer arithmetic, authorization, event traceability, upgrade & pause posture, Move-specific patterns (hot-potato, abilities, UID hygiene).
**Audit date**: 2026-05-29
**Audited build**: `move/sources/` at HEAD (post `fee_bps` parameterization)
**Reviewer**: Splash engineering — internal pre-production sweep

## Executive Summary

| Severity      | Count | Status (truth pass 2026-07-02) |
| ------------- | ----- | -------------------------------- |
| Critical      | 3     | **3 Open**                       |
| High          | 6     | 1 Fixed (H-06) / **5 Open**      |
| Medium        | 8     | **8 Open**                       |
| Low           | 6     | **6 Open / advisory**            |
| Informational | 4     | Convention / housekeeping        |

**Truth-pass correction:** the prior summary overstated scaffold remediation.
No Phase A Move rewrites have shipped in this branch. The detailed findings
below are the source of truth until the named Move modules are rewritten and
their tests pass. The only previously verified fixed item retained here is
H-06 fee-bps parameterization.

The protocol cleanly separates settlement, peg monitoring, business identity, and dual-stablecoin TTL handling — those four modules (`settlement`, `peg_monitor`, `business_account`, `dual_treasury`) are well-structured and resource-safe.

The remaining four modules (`smart_treasury`, `payment_intent`, `audit_anchor`, `receipt_v2`) are explicitly labelled "Phase 1 scaffold" in their headers. They are **not production-grade** in their current form — `smart_treasury::add_usdc` is fundamentally broken, `payment_intent::create_payment_intent` accepts spoofed sender addresses, and several functions have no authorization at all. **Do not publish these scaffold modules to mainnet** without rewriting.

---

## Re-audit pass — 2026-07-13

**Scope**: all 9 modules under `move/sources/` at HEAD. Methodology: OtterSec
checklist (capabilities, authority, asset flow, replay, events, upgrade
posture) + OpenZeppelin math standards. `sui move build` passes (CLI 1.59.1).
`sui move test` is blocked by a pre-existing incompatibility between the
pinned deepbook rev's own test files and the CLI stdlib — unrelated to
`splash_protocol` sources; tracked as a toolchain item.

**Verification of prior findings.** The scaffold rewrites HAVE landed in this
tree: C-01/C-02 (smart_treasury holds a real `Balance<T>`), C-03 + H-01/02/03
(payment_intent binds sender via `tx_context`, uses `&Clock`, refunds
overpay), H-05 (peg state initializes broken-until-first-update), M-01/M-02
(audit_anchor AdminCap-gated, real verification), M-03/L-05 (receipt_v2
immutable + gated). The "Open" statuses in the 2026-05-29 table below are
retained as history; module doc-comments name the finding IDs they fix.

**New findings (this pass):**

| ID | Sev | Finding | Status |
|----|-----|---------|--------|
| S-01 | Medium | `BusinessAccount` has `store`, so a KYB-verified account object can be transferred/sold; `settle_payment` accepted any holder. **Fixed**: `settle_payment` now asserts `owner == tx_context::sender` (abort 106 `E_NOT_ACCOUNT_OWNER`). Ability itself cannot change in an upgrade — flag for next package version. | Fixed (mitigation) |
| S-02 | Medium | `SettlementPool.protocol_fees` had no extraction path — protocol revenue permanently locked in the shared object. **Fixed**: AdminCap-gated `withdraw_fees` + `FeesWithdrawn` event. | Fixed |
| S-03 | Low | `ComplianceCap` (`key`-only) could never be rotated to a new custodian. **Fixed**: `transfer_cap`. | Fixed |
| S-04 | Low | Shared `PaymentIntent` objects lived forever after finalization (storage growth). **Fixed**: `delete_finalized` (abort 412 `E_STILL_PENDING`). | Fixed |
| S-05 | Low | Raw u128 fee math in `settlement` replaced with OpenZeppelin `u64::mul_div(..., rounding::down())` — checked overflow, rounding documented as payer-favoring. | Fixed |
| S-06 | Info | `AdminCap` has `key, store` — publicly transferable/wrappable. Custody policy must treat it as a bearer asset; ability change requires a new package (upgrade rules forbid ability edits). | Advisory |
| S-07 | Info | `settle_batch` attributes `PaymentExecuted` events to whichever `BusinessAccount` the operator passes; attribution is operator-trusted, not chain-enforced. | Advisory |
| S-08 | Info | `payment_intent::create` mints its `SettleReceipt` at creation time, so `SettlementAnchored` can fire for intents that never confirm. Off-chain indexers must join on `IntentConfirmed` before treating an anchor as a settlement. | Advisory |
| S-09 | Info | `assert_deepbook_liquidity` in the caller-facing `settle_payment` path reads a caller-chosen `Pool<T, QuoteAsset>`; a permissionlessly-created pool with self-provided liquidity satisfies the guard. Acceptable today because the guard only gates the caller's own funds, but do not repurpose it to protect pooled funds. | Advisory |

New abort codes to mirror in `lib/server/sui-settlement.ts::ABORT_CODES`:
`106 E_NOT_ACCOUNT_OWNER`, `412 E_STILL_PENDING`.

## Custody & liquidity pass — 2026-08-13

**Scope**: the capability split required by `docs/splash-wallet-onboarding-custody-spec.md`
§10 (cold multisig holds money authority; hot operator key runs the daemons),
plus a live-fire investigation of why batch payouts never settled on testnet.
Methodology: same OtterSec checklist, plus reproduction against the live
testnet SUI/DBUSDC pool `0x1c19362c…`.

**New findings (this pass):**

| ID | Sev | Finding | Status |
|----|-----|---------|--------|
| S-10 | Medium | Every routine attestation (`peg_monitor::update_peg`, `audit_anchor::anchor_audit_hash`, `receipt_v2::create_receipt`, `smart_treasury::emit_rebalance`) required `&AdminCap` — the same cap that authorizes withdrawals. Because the peg daemon must sign every ~30s, `AdminCap` could never move to the cold 2-of-3 multisig, so a compromised operator host held full money authority. **Fixed**: new `AttestationCap` (`key` only, no `store` — non-transferable, minted/destroyed by `AdminCap`) gates the four non-financial writes; `AdminCap` keeps withdraw/allocate/redeem/config only. | Fixed |
| S-11 | High | `peg_monitor::assert_deepbook_liquidity` rejected **100% of batches regardless of liquidity**, via two independent bugs: (a) it required `remaining_base == 0`, unsatisfiable on a lot-quantized book whose input-fee quote path also deducts the taker fee from the input — measured remainder was ~0.098 SUI at every size from 1.1 to 5.0; (b) slippage was priced against the *requested* quantity, charging the unfilled dust as if it executed at zero, turning a real 56 bps into a reported 809 bps and tripping `E_SLIPPAGE_EXCEEDED` on a healthy pool. **Fixed**: require `filled/requested >= MIN_FILL_BPS` (9,000) and price the filled base. Arithmetic pinned in `tests/deepbook-liquidity-guard.test.mjs`. | Fixed (needs republish) |
| S-12 | Medium | `settle_batch` calls `assert_deepbook_liquidity` against pooled funds — exactly the repurposing **S-09** warns against. The pool argument is operator-supplied and DeepBook pools are permissionlessly creatable, so a compromised operator could stand up a pool, seed it with their own liquidity, and satisfy the depth and slippage asserts trivially while draining the shared `SettlementPool`. **Fixed**: `ComplianceConfig.allowed_deepbook_pools: VecSet<ID>` (non-empty, capped at `MAX_ALLOWED_POOLS = 8`, mutated only through `allow_pool` / `disallow_pool`, each emitting its own event); `assert_deepbook_liquidity` now calls `assert_pool_allowed(config, object::id(pool))` **before reading a single field off the pool** (abort 353). Off-chain preflight in `lib/server/sui-settlement.ts::assertDeepbookPoolWhitelisted` blocks a mismatched `DEEPBOOK_POOL_ID` before the PTB is built; encoding semantics pinned in `tests/deepbook-pool-whitelist.test.mjs`. | Fixed (needs republish) |

New abort codes to mirror in `lib/server/sui-settlement.ts::ABORT_CODES`:
`107 E_BELOW_MINIMUM` (settlement below `min_settlement_amount`), `304
E_INSUFFICIENT_DEPTH` (now also fires on a sub-`MIN_FILL_BPS` fill), `353
E_POOL_NOT_ALLOWED`, `354 E_TOO_MANY_POOLS`, `355 E_POOL_LIST_EMPTY`.

**S-09 status.** The advisory said "do not repurpose [the DeepBook guard] to
protect pooled funds". S-12 is that repurposing, and the whitelist is what makes
it defensible: the guard now measures a venue the protocol chose rather than one
the caller chose. S-09 stays Advisory — the guard still proves depth on a book
the settlement never trades against, so it is a sanity check on market
conditions, not a proof of execution.

**Publish dependency.** S-11 and the `min_settlement_amount` field on
`ComplianceConfig` are source-level fixes. The deployed package is immutable
and predates both, so batch payouts stay blocked on-chain until the package is
republished and `scripts/set-compliance-config.mjs` runs against the new
`ComplianceConfig`. See `docs/KEY-CEREMONY-RUNBOOK.md` §4.

## A-11 BUILT — splash_meter + delegation — 2026-08-19

The ruling of 2026-08-18 is implemented. Three packages now:

```
move/splash_core/     mainnet, IMMUTABLE, no dependencies      14 tests passing
move/splash_meter/    velocity bounds, UPGRADEABLE, no deps    22 tests passing
move/splash_custody/  every Balance<T>, publishes on licence   tests blocked*
```

\* **Resolved 2026-08-18.** All three suites now run — 14 + 22 + 16. The DeepBook
pin moved to `7b48e61b`, the commit immediately before DeepBook's own tests
adopted `std::unit_test::destroy`; the Move stdlib shipped with Sui CLI 1.59.1
exports only `assert_eq` and `assert_ref_eq` from that module, so every later rev
aborted the whole test build before our modules were reached. Verified before
moving: `FLOAT_SCALING` is `1_000_000_000` in both revs (this is the constant
`DEEPBOOK_PRICE_SCALING` must match, and a wrong value there is the Cetus failure
mode), the three view functions the guard calls have byte-identical signatures,
and neither rev sets `published-at` so no on-chain address changed.

**Superseded 2026-08-18.** The Sui CLI was upgraded to 1.77.2 and the pin moved
forward to `daa5a951`. The floor was 1.61.1 — `std::unit_test::destroy` first
shipped there — so the constraint was the toolchain, never DeepBook. All three
suites were re-run on the new CLI before the pin moved and again after, and the
scaling constant and view signatures were re-verified at the new rev.
**The repo now requires Sui CLI >= 1.61.1.**

### What was built

| Piece | Property |
|---|---|
| `spend_meter::SpendMeter` | 24 hourly buckets over a 24h window, rolled forward lazily by the spender's own transaction — Sui has no cron, so any design needing one silently stops working when nobody calls it. |
| Asymmetric limit changes | Tightening is instant. Relaxing costs 48h of public `LimitsProposed` notice and is capped at 4x per step, so a compromised key must announce a raise two days before it can use it. Tightening cancels a queued raise, or the tighten would be theatre. |
| Bootstrap restore | Returning to the ceremony-agreed limits is instant, because recovering from a defensive tighten is not a relaxation — otherwise the 48h cost is exactly the pressure that makes operators avoid tightening at all. |
| `guardian::GuardianCap` | Pause only. Never resume, never spend, never name a recipient. A stolen guardian is a denial of service by construction, which is what makes it safe on an always-on watcher host. Resuming is cold-key work. |
| `settlement.credits` | Per-tenant credit `Table` inside the pool. Cross-tenant drain becomes structurally impossible rather than assert-prevented: a batch can only spend `credits[business_owner]`. |
| `delegation::PayoutDelegation` | The tenant grants it from their own wallet and it lands with the operator. TTL <= 30 days, revocable by owner, by admin, or pool-wide via an epoch bump. |
| Fixed `fee_recipient` | `withdraw_fees` takes no recipient argument. Repointing requires the pool be paused first, so a redirect cannot be slipped between two normal sweeps. |

### Why the delegation replaces `&BusinessAccount` rather than joining it

`settle_batch` is deleted, not fixed. It took `&AdminCap` (cold multisig) and
`&BusinessAccount` (tenant), and a Sui transaction may only name owned objects
belonging to its own sender — two owners, one transaction, impossible. The
delegation carries the tenant's identity, so attribution stays chain-enforced
(closing S-07) while the run becomes signable by one party.

Four independent bounds apply to every batch, all charged UPFRONT before a single
coin moves so a breach aborts the run whole rather than half-paying a payroll:
the delegation must be live; the tenant's own meter; the pool's meter; and the
tenant's credit.

### One design note worth recording

`public(package)` does not cross package boundaries, so the meter's mutators are
`public`. That is safe for a reason worth stating: a `SpendMeter` is a `store`
FIELD, not an object, and Move makes struct fields private to their defining
module. `&mut pool.payout_meter` can only be borrowed inside `settlement.move`,
which gates every borrow behind `AdminCap`, a live delegation, or a
`GuardianCap`. **The mutable reference is the capability.** The same argument
gates guardian minting, via a `&SpendMeter` argument.

### Treasury metering — completed 2026-08-19

Both treasuries now carry the same bounds as the settlement pool, and three
caller-supplied guards were moved into storage:

| Was | Now |
|---|---|
| `smart_treasury::allocate(.., operating_minimum: u64, ..)` — the floor was an ARGUMENT, so `assert!(balance - amount >= operating_minimum)` compared caller against caller. Passing `0` erased it. | **`allocate` deleted.** The floor is a stored field on the treasury; `withdraw` enforces it. Lowering it requires a pause first, so a quiet reduction between two normal withdrawals is not available. |
| `smart_treasury::withdraw(.., recipient: address, ..)` — any destination. | Destination must be on the treasury's allowlist. The last entry cannot be removed (that bricks rather than secures). |
| `smart_treasury::redeem` | Deleted — it was a bare alias for `withdraw`. Two entry points to a treasury, one with a defeatable guard, is worse than one that is correct. |
| `dual_treasury::emergency_sweep(.., recipient: address, ..)` — caller-chosen destination for the WHOLE balance, on the path reachable precisely when things are already going wrong. | Destination fixed at buffer creation. In an event log a redirected sweep is indistinguishable from a legitimate one, which is what made this the worst of the three. |
| `dual_treasury::settle_usdt(.., kyc_tier: u8, min_kyc_tier: u8, ..)` — **both sides of the compliance comparison came from the caller.** `kyc_tier: 5, min_kyc_tier: 0` always passes. | The threshold is stored on the buffer, so the assert compares a caller-supplied claim against a stored policy. Lowering it requires a pause. |

All three value paths (`smart_treasury::withdraw`, `dual_treasury::settle_usdt`,
`dual_treasury::emergency_sweep`) now charge a `SpendMeter`, and each object can
mint its own pause-only `GuardianCap`.

### Still open

- A-15 (no beneficiary screening) is untouched: delegated batches still pay
  unscreened, caller-supplied addresses.
- The DeepBook pin is held ~7 months behind `main` purely by the CLI's stdlib.
  Upgrading the Sui CLI lifts the constraint and is needed for gRPC publishing
  anyway, so both should move together.

## A-11 / A-12 design ruling — 2026-08-18

Three rival designs were argued by independent advocates, each cross-examined by
an agent who did not write it, then judged. All three cross-examiners returned
`build_with_changes` — no design survived intact.

### The finding that reframed the problem

**`settle_batch` and `settle_sui_batch` are already UNCALLABLE after the key
ceremony, and the M-04 fix in commit `188af29` is what made them so.**

`business_account.move:102` does `transfer::transfer(account, owner)`, so
`BusinessAccount` is address-owned by the tenant. `AdminCap` goes to the cold
multisig. A Sui transaction can only name owned objects belonging to its
*sender* — so one transaction cannot supply both, and the
`owner == tx_context::sender` assert added for S-07 pins the sender to the
tenant, which excludes the `AdminCap` input entirely.

The security property was right; the shape was wrong. Runbook §1 option A
("accept it — batch becomes a multisig-signed operation") is therefore not
"safest but inconvenient", it is **not executable**. Correcting that is the
single most valuable output of the exercise.

### Ruling

Adopt a hybrid: **spend meters + credit segregation + tenant delegation**, with
the delegation *removing* `&BusinessAccount` from the batch signature rather than
adding a capability beside it.

| Component | Package | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `splash_meter::spend_meter` | new, upgradeable | Sliding-window ceiling: per-tx cap, per-window cap, lazy roll-forward (Sui has no cron, so the spender's own transaction advances the window). Relaxations cost 4x per step and 48h of public `LimitsProposed` notice. |
| `splash_meter::guardian` | new | `GuardianCap`, pause-only, never resume, never spend — safe for an automated watcher, and a stolen one is a denial of service rather than a theft. |
| `settlement::credits` | custody | Per-tenant credit ledger inside the pool. Makes cross-tenant drain structurally impossible rather than assert-prevented. |
| `PayoutDelegation` | custody | Tenant grants it from their own wallet; it lands with the operator. `settle_batch_delegated` takes the delegation *instead of* `&BusinessAccount`, which is what makes a batch executable by one signer at all. TTL <= 30 days. |
| Fixed `fee_recipient` / `sweep_recipient` | custody | Set at pool creation by the multisig. `withdraw_fees` takes no recipient argument. |

Sized against real volume — RM 250k/month is roughly USD 2.5k/business day — a
USD 50k/24h pool ceiling is ~20x actual flow. It will not bind in normal
operation, and it caps a total compromise at $50k/day instead of everything in
one PTB.

### Custody topology (A-12)

| Address | Holds | A compromise yields |
|---|---|---|
| **M** cold 2-of-3 multisig | `AdminCap` | Everything *metered* — bounded per window, only to fixed recipients; raising a ceiling costs 48h of public notice. Cannot drain the pool: `settle_batch_delegated` needs a delegation M does not hold. |
| **H** hot operator server | `AttestationCap`, gas key, tenants' delegations | False peg readings and forged anchors — an integrity problem, not a solvency one. Payouts only to addresses a tenant already named, bounded by two meters. |
| **G** guardian host, separate machine | `GuardianCap` | Denial of service. Zero coins, by construction. |
| **C** compliance custodian | `ComplianceCap` | Pause, or a widened DeepBook whitelist. Moves no funds. |

**May `AdminCap` and `AttestationCap` share an address? No — never.**
`AttestationCap` exists *because* `update_peg` fires every ~30s, roughly 2,880
signatures a day from an internet-facing host. Co-locating the money authority
there is precisely the condition A-12 records.

**They currently do.** `attestationCapObjectId()` fell back to `adminCapId`, and
`.env.example` shipped `SPLASH_ATTESTATION_CAP_ID` empty. **Fixed in this
commit** — the fallback now throws. It was convenient exactly because it made
the split invisible, which is what made it the bug.

`compliance_config::create` transfers `ComplianceCap` to `ctx.sender()`, i.e. to
M. Rotating it to C via `transfer_cap` is a **required ceremony step that was
not in the runbook**.

### Shipped now (all three impossible after the immutable publish)

| ID | Finding | Status |
|----|---------|--------|
| M-07 | `verify_business` asserts `!is_verified` and no de-verification path existed anywhere. An account verified on mainnet was verified **forever**, in an immutable package — a business whose KYB lapses, or which turns out to be a shell, could never be un-verified, and `settle_payment` gates on exactly that flag. **Fixed**: `business_account::revoke_verification` (abort 5), resetting `risk_score` so a stale score cannot later be read as a current assessment. | Fixed |
| M-08 | `set_paused` is `ComplianceCap`-only; that cap is `key` with no `store`, minted once, movable only by its own holder. Losing it **while paused** deadlocks `assert_pegged` and therefore every settlement path, permanently, with no recovery. **Fixed**: `compliance_config::admin_set_paused` break-glass. This does weaken the two-key pause — a permanent unrecoverable brick is the strictly worse outcome. | Fixed |
| M-09 | `confirm_payment_intent` took `Coin<SUI>` — a USD corridor settling in a volatile asset, so SUI movement between intent and confirmation changed what the recipient received. **Fixed**: generic `Coin<T>` **with the asset bound at creation** and asserted at confirmation (abort 414). A bare generic would have been strictly worse than the hardcode: the only amount check is `value(payment) >= amount_usd`, so any coin type could discharge the obligation — 100,000,000 units of a worthless token for a 100 USDC debt. | Fixed |

### Not yet built

`splash_meter`, credit segregation and `PayoutDelegation` are a multi-package
Move project with its own test suite; the ruling's own build order puts the
settlement rewrite last and largest. They land before `splash_custody` publishes,
which is Phase 1 — there is no Phase 0 exposure, because custody has no bytecode
on chain.

### What none of this protects against

- A compromised cold multisig still extracts one window per window, indefinitely.
  The bound buys time; monitoring is what spends it.
- An attacker who owns the server **and onboards a shell tenant** through the KYB
  queue they themselves operate. Credit segregation caps this at what the
  attacker funded — a laundering channel, not theft of other tenants' money.
  Nothing in Move fixes the KYB approval process.
- A-15 (no beneficiary screening) is untouched: delegated batches still pay
  unscreened, caller-supplied addresses.
- Sui has no timelock. The 48h delay is a *detection window*, worthless if nobody
  watches `LimitsProposed`.

## Mainnet cutover — package split & M1/M3 — 2026-08-17

**The structural change.** `move/` split into two packages. `splash_core`
(business_account, payment_intent, audit_anchor, receipt_v2, compliance_config,
peg_monitor) publishes to mainnet; `splash_custody` (settlement, smart_treasury,
dual_treasury, liquidity_guard) publishes only when the Labuan e-money licence is
granted. Non-custody stops being an assert someone can forget and becomes a
property of the type system: **no struct in `splash_core` holds a `Balance<T>`**,
enforced by `scripts/check-core-no-balance.mjs` in CI
(`.github/workflows/core-invariant.yml`) and in `npm run lint`.

**The checker was itself defeated once and rebuilt.** An adversarial review
compiled a complete client omnibus into `splash_core` — per-client balances in a
`Table`, a `vector<Coin>`, an `Option<Balance>`, an aliased `Balance as Ledger`,
a field split across two lines, a single-line struct, and a module in a
subdirectory the non-recursive scan never opened — while v1 reported "invariant
holds". v1 matched only `name: Type<` at the start of a physical line. The
rewrite parses struct bodies out of comment-stripped source and matches value
types at any nesting depth under any local alias, walks `sources/` recursively,
and cross-checks its module count against the compiler's bytecode output. All
seven bypasses are pinned in `tests/core-invariant-check.test.mjs`. A control
quoted as evidence has to actually hold, so it is now tested like one.

| ID | Sev | Finding | Status |
|----|-----|---------|--------|
| M-01 | High | `payment_intent::create` returned `(PaymentIntent, SettleReceipt)` and minted the receipt with `settled_at: now` and **no `Coin` anywhere in the function**. The type asserted a settlement that had not happened, and `audit_anchor` would anchor that assertion on chain as proof of payment — a forgeable receipt. **Fixed**: `create` returns `PaymentIntent` only; `SettleReceipt` is minted solely by `confirm_payment_intent`, which consumes a `Coin<T>`. Pinned by `core_invariants_tests`. | Fixed |
| M-02 | Medium | `unpack_settle_receipt` was `public(package)`, so any module in the package could consume a `SettleReceipt` and discard the fields without anchoring — breaking "every settlement is anchored" silently. **Fixed**: `audit_anchor::AnchorWitness`, constructible only inside `audit_anchor`, is now required (abort 413). Note the witness is generic + module-checked rather than named directly: `audit_anchor` already depends on `payment_intent` and Move forbids circular imports, so binding on the witness type's defining module achieves the same restriction. | Fixed |
| M-03 | Medium | `settlement::deposit` was open to anyone and recorded nothing — the pool could not be reconciled, a deposit could not be attributed or returned, and an unsolicited deposit into a shared object that pays third parties is an obvious layering vector. **Fixed**: AdminCap-gated, emits `PoolFunded{pool_id, depositor, amount, new_balance, funded_at_ms}`. | Fixed |
| M-04 | Medium | `settle_batch` / `settle_sui_batch` asserted `is_verified` but omitted the `owner == sender` binding that `settle_payment` has, leaving S-07's event attribution operator-trusted. **Fixed**: binding mirrored into both. **Consequence:** batches must now be signed by the business owner rather than driven unilaterally by the operator's `AdminCap`. That is a real change to the batch operating model, made deliberately — an operator who can both move pooled funds and choose whose name is on the payout is the authority concentration S-10 exists to break up. The delegation design (a bounded `SettlementCap`, cf. A-11) lands before custody publishes. | Fixed |
| M-05 | Info | `'X-Source-Entity': 'splash-my'` on every Labuan settlement call, plus `intercompanyRef` and MYR conversion aliases — all asserting a Malaysian leg that the licence perimeter does not have. Splash Labuan receives USD only. **Fixed**: `'splash-labuan'`; the MYR aliases and the intercompany field removed. | Fixed |
| M-06 | Info | `content/money-path.ts` named Hata as the conversion venue without Hata being a partner of record, against the file's own rule. **Fixed**: removed, and `splashIsParty: boolean` added to every step so `tests/money-path.test.mjs` asserts the header claim ("Splash orchestrates — we never hold your funds") as data: exactly one step may have `splashIsParty === true`, and it moves no money. | Fixed |

**Dependency posture.** `splash_core` now has **no third-party Move
dependencies** — the DeepBook liquidity guard moved to custody, where the pooled
funds it protects actually live. Two consequences: the mainnet package's
dependency surface is the Sui framework and nothing else (Cetus was drained
through a third-party math library, and the strongest defence against that class
is not having the dependency); and `sui move test` runs, which it previously
could not — the pinned DeepBook rev ships test files that fail to compile against
this toolchain, aborting the test build before our modules were reached. **Move
test coverage went from 0 runnable tests to 10 passing.**

**Upgrade policy: `splash_core` publishes IMMUTABLE.** The `UpgradeCap` is burned
at publish. A settlement contract whose logic cannot change is a stronger
regulatory position than one under multisig, where the question becomes "who
holds the keys" and the answer is a custody procedure taken on trust. The cost is
real and accepted: a post-publish bug requires a fresh publish and a
re-bootstrap of every shared object. See `STATUS.md`.

## Adversarial pass — 2026-08-13 (application tier)

**Scope**: 24 agents across two workflows — Move authority, Move arithmetic,
server authority, off-chain money path, ABI drift, compliance state machines,
then a second sweep modelling three real incidents: **Step Finance** (Jan 2026,
~$30-40M — compromised executive *devices*, not a contract bug), **Cetus** (May
2025, $223M on Sui — `checked_shlw` used the wrong overflow threshold and Move's
`<<` truncates instead of aborting), and **Hedgey** ($44.7M — unvalidated
caller-supplied parameters). Every finding was put to an independent refuter;
what follows survived.

| ID | Sev | Finding | Status |
|----|-----|---------|--------|
| A-01 | Critical | The 6-digit payout code on both money routes was validated with `/^\d{6}$/` and nothing else — no secret, no verification, no MFA dependency in the repo. `000000` authorized a payroll run out of the shared `SettlementPool`. `requireTotp` was persisted, rendered, and read by no authorization path. **Fixed**: RFC 6238 on `node:crypto`, pinned against the RFC 4226 published vectors, single-use per step, fail-closed when unenrolled. | Fixed |
| A-02 | High | `transfers/authorize` took the paying account from `body.businessAccountId`; `GET /api/ledger` with no `accountId` returned every account's entries. Enumerate, then debit. **Fixed**: account derived from the session in all four routes; a foreign id gets 403. | Fixed |
| A-03 | High | A stablecoin funding session CREDITed the payer's ledger but the route DEBITed only on the `held` branch — one deposit funded two payouts. **Fixed**: payer debited for every source, non-negative assert before settlement. | Fixed |
| A-04 | High | Every settlement PTB called `update_peg(0,0)` as command #1 and `settle_payment` — which calls `assert_pegged` — as command #2. **The on-chain peg circuit breaker read a perfect peg the same transaction had written one instruction earlier.** It could not fail. **Fixed**: the pushed value is measured; a fabricated `$1.00` from the Pyth mock fallback is never attested; with no live reading the command is omitted so `PegState` goes stale and `assert_pegged` aborts (302). | Fixed |
| A-05 | High | Admin session tokens were `nonce.hmac(nonce)` — no issue time, no identity, no revocation. A copied cookie verified forever; sign-out cleared only the browser's copy. **Fixed**: signed issue time enforced server-side, subject bound, `revokeAllAdminSessions()`. | Fixed |
| A-06 | High | `SPLASH_TEST_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS` unconditionally overrides the beneficiary on every live path, per row in a batch — and was writable at runtime via `PUT /api/admin/contracts`, whose entire authorization was "is there a session". A stolen admin cookie redirected every payout, persisted to disk, dashboard unchanged. **Fixed**: env-only (403 from that route), refused on mainnet, logged. | Fixed |
| A-07 | High | Batch authorization minted a fresh batch per call — a dropped response plus a re-submit paid every recipient twice. **Fixed**: idempotency key. | Fixed |
| A-08 | Medium | `perTransferLimitUsd` / `dailyLimitUsd` / `approvalThresholdUsd` / `requireDualApproval` were persisted, cross-checked and rendered — and enforced nowhere. **Fixed**: enforced in both routes; daily volume summed from the ledger. | Fixed |
| A-09 | Medium | `settle_batch` looped an unbounded caller vector (one event + one created Coin per row) under a flat 10,000,000 MIST budget. Above ~1,023 rows Sui's 1,024-event / 1,024-command ceilings make it unexecutable at any budget. **Fixed**: `MAX_BATCH_ROWS = 256` (abort 108), gas scales with row count. | Fixed |
| A-10 | High | `ComplianceConfig.paused` gates `settle_payment`/`settle_batch`, but the live customer path is `payment_intent::confirm_payment_intent`, which imports neither `compliance_config` nor `peg_monitor` — pausing halted batches while transfers kept executing. **Mitigated off-chain** (both routes check `paused`); the chain-side guard needs the republish. | Mitigated |
| A-11 | High | **Nothing bounds an `AdminCap` call.** `withdraw_fees`, `smart_treasury::withdraw`, `allocate` (whose `operating_minimum` is a caller-supplied `u64` — pass `0`) and `settle_batch` have no amount cap, velocity limit, cooldown or timelock. One PTB signed with the operator key drains the pool, the fees and the treasury. This is the Step Finance shape exactly. | **Open** |
| A-12 | High | The S-10 cap split is **not in effect at runtime**: `attestationCapObjectId()` falls back to `adminCapId`, `.env.example` ships `SPLASH_ATTESTATION_CAP_ID=` empty, and `recordBatchSettlementOnSui` passes `SPLASH_ADMIN_CAP_ID` directly. The hot key is still the money authority until the ceremony runs. | **Open** |
| A-13 | High | Seal enforces no per-tenant policy: one global allowlist object, and the operator key decrypts every blob ever sealed. Seal also falls open to a hardcoded AES key while Walrus publishes for real. `/api/audit/[intentId]` has no ownership check. | **Open** |
| A-14 | Medium | Batch rows are USD micro-units passed as SUI MIST on a `SettlementPool<SUI>`. $100 becomes 100,000,000 MIST = 0.1 SUI. Recipients are underpaid and the on-chain minimum is effectively disabled on that path. Correct for 6-decimal USDC; wrong for the 9-decimal SUI pool. Needs a product decision on what the SUI pool represents. | **Open** |
| A-15 | Medium | No beneficiary screening on either payout path — Elliptic is referenced but is a stub, and the compliance engine is wired only to the 0xWal proposal route. Batch pays unscreened, caller-supplied raw Sui addresses. | **Open** |
| A-16 | Medium | Operator-signed PTBs are never serialized and never `setGasPayment` — concurrent `after()` callbacks sign different transactions over the same owned gas coins. Best case a spurious FAILED transfer; worst case the operator's whole coin set locks for an epoch. | **Open** |
| A-17 | High | Nothing ever writes `KYB_SUBMITTED` or `KYB_PROVIDER_APPROVED`, so `approveOrgKybOnChain` always throws and `verify_business` is unreachable. `readOrgKybState` also fails open to `ACTIVE` when the org row is missing, returning a success shape with `digest: ''` for a verification that never happened. | **Open** |
| A-18 | Medium | `/api/kyb/cases/latest` matches on public `businessName` / `registrationNumber` with no org check, returning review notes, risk tier, Sumsub applicant id and every document's filename + SHA-256. | **Open** |
| A-19 | Medium | `resolveAuthorityForSession` auto-provisions a missing user as `checker` → `APPROVER`, so any email that can mint a session becomes a valid second signature. zkLogin also hardcodes `DEFAULT_ORG_ID` and makes nonce binding optional at the client's discretion. | **Open** |

**What the incidents imply here.** Step Finance died on key custody, not code —
which makes **A-11 and A-12 the highest-value open items in this repo**: the cap
split is written but not in effect, and even once it is, no value-moving Move
function has a ceiling, so a single compromised hot key still drains everything
in one transaction. Cetus died on a guard whose constant was wrong; the
equivalent check here passed — `DEEPBOOK_PRICE_SCALING = 1e9` matches DeepBook's
own `FLOAT_SCALING`, verified against the pinned dependency source, and the fee
math already routes through OpenZeppelin's checked `u64::mul_div`. The
denomination defect that did surface (**A-14**) is a units error at the
application boundary, not in the contract arithmetic.

---

**Numbering note.** `S-06`/`S-07` are the 2026-07-13 advisories above
(`AdminCap` abilities; `settle_batch` event attribution). The cap split and the
DeepBook guard fix are `S-10`/`S-11` — module doc-comments use those IDs.

## Findings

### C-01 · `smart_treasury::add_usdc` always aborts on non-zero coins
**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/smart_treasury.move:51-61`

The function adds the coin's value to `treasury.usdc_balance` (a `u64` counter), then calls `coin::destroy_zero(usdc_coin)`. `destroy_zero` aborts if the coin's value is non-zero — the only path that succeeds is depositing a coin of value 0, in which case the counter is also incremented by 0.

In effect, the treasury contract **cannot accept any USDC at all**. Worse, the function pretends to credit the deposit before aborting, which would mislead off-chain callers reading the partial transaction trace.

The type parameter is also wrong — the function accepts `Coin<SUI>` but the field name and comments say USDC.

**Recommendation**: Rewrite to actually store the deposit in a `Balance<USDC>` field on `SmartTreasury`. Use a proper type parameter (`Coin<USDC>`). Emit a `UsdcDeposited` event. Remove the `destroy_zero` call. Mirror the pattern in `dual_treasury::deposit`.

---

### C-02 · `SmartTreasury` does not actually hold any value
**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/smart_treasury.move:13-20`

`SmartTreasury` only contains `u64` counters (`usdc_balance`, `usd_balance`). There is no `Balance<T>` field on the struct. All "balances" are accounting fiction with no on-chain backing.

`rebalance_treasury` increments/decrements `usd_balance` based on an admin-supplied `amount_usd` argument — there is no movement of any actual coin. A compromised admin can mint arbitrary phantom balances; the dashboard treasury figure is unreliable.

**Recommendation**: Add `usdc_balance: Balance<USDC>` and `usd_balance: Balance<USD>` (or whatever stable type represents USD on Sui). All mutations must move real balance via `balance::join` / `balance::split`. Remove the `u64` counters or expose them as views derived from `balance::value(&field)`.

---

### C-03 · `payment_intent::create_payment_intent` accepts a spoofed `sender`
**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/payment_intent.move:26-50`

The function takes `sender: address` as a caller-supplied parameter rather than reading it from `tx_context::sender(ctx)`. Any caller can therefore create a `PaymentIntent` claiming any address as the sender.

Downstream, `recipient` is also caller-supplied — combined, an attacker can fabricate intents that look like they came from victim A and pay attacker B, and these intents will appear in off-chain indexers as if A authorized them. Even if `confirm_payment_intent` requires the right coin, the intent itself is a falsifiable record on-chain.

**Recommendation**:
```move
public entry fun create_payment_intent(
    recipient: address,
    amount_usd: u64,
    target_currency: String,
    fx_rate_usd_local: u64,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
) {
    let sender = tx_context::sender(ctx);
    // ...
}
```
Same pattern applies anywhere `address` is taken as an argument that should be the caller.

---

### H-01 · `payment_intent` uses `epoch_timestamp_ms` instead of `Clock`
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/payment_intent.move:34, 59, 72`

`tx_context::epoch_timestamp_ms(ctx)` returns the epoch start time, which only advances at epoch boundaries (~24 hours on Sui mainnet). The 5-minute expiration window (`now + 300_000`) is therefore meaningless — within the same epoch, every `confirm_payment_intent` and `cancel_payment_intent` call sees the same "now". Expired intents may remain confirmable for hours; pending intents may show as expired immediately at an epoch boundary.

**Recommendation**: Take `clock: &Clock` parameter and call `clock::timestamp_ms(clock)`. Match the pattern already used in `peg_monitor` and `settlement`.

---

### H-02 · `payment_intent::confirm_payment_intent` has no sender authorization
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/payment_intent.move:53-68`

The intent is a `key + store` shared object after `transfer::share_object`. Any address can therefore call `confirm_payment_intent` with any coin ≥ `intent.amount_usd`. This enables griefing — a third party can confirm an intent at the cheapest possible payment, draining the recipient's expected upside, or front-running with a cheaper coin denomination.

**Recommendation**: Add `assert!(tx_context::sender(ctx) == intent.sender, E_UNAUTHORIZED);`. Or: require the caller to hold a `PaymentApprovalCap` minted at intent creation and given only to the sender.

---

### H-03 · `payment_intent::confirm_payment_intent` over-charges silently
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/payment_intent.move:61-67`

The check is `amount >= intent.amount_usd`, then the **entire** payment coin is forwarded to the recipient. If the caller supplies a 100 SUI coin to confirm a 1 SUI intent, the recipient receives 100 SUI and there is no refund of the 99 SUI overpay.

**Recommendation**: Split the coin: `let to_pay = coin::split(&mut payment, intent.amount_usd, ctx);` then transfer only `to_pay` to recipient and return `payment` to sender (or destroy if zero). Pattern already used in `settlement::settle_payment` for the fee split.

---

### H-04 · `business_account::submit_application` has no rate limit
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/business_account.move:39-59`

Anyone can call `submit_application` unlimited times, each call mints a new `BusinessAccount` UID. This is a denial-of-service vector against the off-chain Sumsub indexer and inflates the object table.

**Recommendation**: Either gate creation behind a fee (a small SUI burn deters spam), or require a one-shot capability minted by AdminCap. At minimum, enforce one-application-per-sender by storing applicant addresses in a shared `Table<address, bool>` and asserting they're not already present.

---

### H-05 · `peg_monitor::init_peg_state` initializes deviation at 0 with a current timestamp
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/peg_monitor.move:47-56`

After init, `assert_pegged` passes immediately because (a) deviations are 0 and (b) `last_update_ms = clock::timestamp_ms(clock)`. The first ~60 seconds after init, settlements proceed against zero peg data — without the operator daemon ever having pushed a real Pyth reading.

**Recommendation**: Initialize `usdc_deviation_ppm: MAX_DEVIATION_PPM + 1` and `usdt_deviation_ppm: MAX_DEVIATION_PPM + 1` so `assert_pegged` aborts until the first real `update_peg` lands. Or set `last_update_ms = 0` so staleness check fails until first update.

---

### H-06 · Fee gouging via unbounded `FEE_BPS`
**Severity**: High
**Status**: **Fixed** (2026-05-29)
**Location**: `move/sources/settlement.move`

The contract previously hardcoded `FEE_BPS = 150` (1.50%) while the off-chain quote engine, dashboards, and marketing all advertised 0.80%–1.10%. There was no way to align them without redeploying. Worse — any future change to the constant required a full upgrade.

**Resolution**: `settle_payment` and `settle_batch` now take `fee_bps: u64` as a parameter, bounded by `MAX_FEE_BPS = 200` via `assert!(fee_bps <= MAX_FEE_BPS, E_FEE_EXCEEDED)`. Per-corridor fees are defined in `lib/fx/corridors.ts` and passed by the off-chain settlement layer. The contract emits `fee_bps` in `PaymentSettled` and `PaymentExecuted` for full auditability. See `lib/fx/corridors.ts`, `lib/server/sui-settlement.ts`, and `lib/sui/contracts.ts` for the off-chain pieces.

---

### M-01 · `audit_anchor::anchor_audit_hash` has no caller authorization
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/audit_anchor.move:20-34`

Anyone can call this entry function and create `AuditAnchor` shared objects with arbitrary hashes. The audit trail can be polluted with junk anchors that look identical to real ones to a naive off-chain reader.

**Recommendation**: Gate with `AdminCap` (matching `peg_monitor::update_peg`), or accept a `BusinessAccount` reference and assert `is_verified`. Add a `business_account_id: address` field to the anchor so off-chain indexers can filter by tenant.

---

### M-02 · `audit_anchor::verify_anchor` is tautological
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/audit_anchor.move:37-39`

`verify_anchor(anchor, hash)` simply returns `anchor.audit_hash == hash` — i.e. it tells you whether the value you supplied matches the value already on the anchor you read. This provides no independent verification; off-chain callers can do the comparison themselves without calling the contract.

**Recommendation**: Either remove this function (misleading), or change it to verify against a Merkle root or Walrus CID that the anchor commits to — i.e. give it meaning beyond a string equality check.

---

### M-03 · `receipt_v2::link_audit_anchor` lacks authorization
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/receipt_v2.move:56-62`

The receipt is a shared object; any caller can mutate `audit_anchor_id` to point to a different (possibly fake) anchor. A receipt's audit linkage is therefore not tamper-evident on chain.

**Recommendation**: Require `AdminCap` OR `assert!(tx_context::sender(ctx) == receipt.sender)`. Better: link the anchor at receipt creation and remove the post-hoc setter entirely (immutable receipts).

---

### M-04 · `smart_treasury::rebalance_treasury` shares an object per call
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/smart_treasury.move:64-93`

Every rebalance call creates a new `TreasuryRebalance` shared object via `transfer::share_object`. Over time this fills the object table with one shared object per rebalance event — expensive in storage and gas, hard to query.

**Recommendation**: Replace with an event: `event::emit(TreasuryRebalanced { ... })`. Events are cheap, queryable from indexers, and don't add to the object table.

---

### M-05 · Magic abort codes throughout scaffold modules
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `payment_intent.move:58, 59, 62, 72` · `smart_treasury.move:56, 70, 77`

Scaffold modules use bare integers (`assert!(..., 0)`, `assert!(..., 1)`, etc.) instead of named `const E_FOO: u64 = N;` constants. Diagnosing reverts requires reading the source — off-chain error mapping (see `lib/server/sui-settlement.ts::ABORT_CODES`) has no way to associate human-readable strings with anonymous codes.

**Recommendation**: Define named constants at module top, matching the `E_FOO` convention used in `settlement.move` and `peg_monitor.move`. Add the new codes to `lib/server/sui-settlement.ts::ABORT_CODES`.

---

### M-06 · `business_account::AdminCap` is single-key with no rotation
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Open (architectural)
**Location**: `move/sources/business_account.move:34-36`

`init` mints one `AdminCap` and transfers it to the deployer. There is no multi-sig, no time-locked rotation, no recovery path. If the deployer's key is lost, every admin function (peg updates, KYB verification, treasury seed) becomes uncallable forever — protocol bricked.

**Recommendation**: Wrap `AdminCap` usage behind a multi-sig pattern at the address level (use Sui multisig), or build an on-chain governance module with N-of-M keyholders that can mint replacement AdminCaps after a timelock. At minimum, document the operational policy: where the key lives, who has access, what the rotation cadence is, what the recovery plan is if the key is lost.

---

### M-07 · `dual_treasury` resets TTL on every deposit
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/dual_treasury.move:62-63`

`deposit` overwrites `buffer.intake_ms = now_ms` on each call. Old funds in the buffer get a fresh TTL whenever new funds are added — meaning a 29-minute-old position can be reset to 0 by depositing 1 wei of USDT, indefinitely keeping funds past the intended `USDT_MAX_HOLD_MS` ceiling. The `emergency_sweep` trigger never fires for actively topped-up buffers.

**Recommendation**: Track per-batch intake (e.g. `Table<u64, u64>` keyed by batch id → intake_ms) and enforce TTL per oldest batch. Or: forbid deposits when `buffer.balance > 0` — force one-batch-at-a-time accounting.

---

### M-08 · `dual_treasury` parameter naming hides cap discard
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/dual_treasury.move:54, 75, 99`

Functions take `cap: &AdminCap` then do `let _ = cap;`. This works (the borrow still requires the cap to exist), but the pattern is non-idiomatic and easy to overlook in review — a future change could remove the `let _` line and the borrow would optimize away, breaking access control silently.

**Recommendation**: Use `_admin: &AdminCap` parameter name (Move/Rust convention for "intentionally unused reference"). Match `peg_monitor::update_peg` style.

---

### L-01 · `settlement.move` `MAX_FEE_BPS = 200` may be too loose
**Severity**: Low
**Status**: Open (advisory)
**Location**: `move/sources/settlement.move:23`

Current corridor fees are 80–110 bps. The 200 bps (2%) ceiling is roughly 2× headroom — defensive but allows a misconfigured quote engine to charge double the highest legitimate fee without aborting.

**Recommendation**: Tighten to 150 bps if no genuine 1.5%+ corridors are planned. Or: emit a `HighFeeWarning` event when `fee_bps > 120` so off-chain monitors can alert on suspicious quotes.

---

### L-02 · `peg_monitor::assert_pegged` aborts on either-stablecoin break
**Severity**: Low
**Status**: Open (intentional conservatism)
**Location**: `move/sources/peg_monitor.move:83-89`

A USDC-denominated settlement aborts if USDT's peg is broken (and vice versa). The conservative posture is reasonable — broad peg stress usually correlates — but it does mean USDT operational issues block USDC flow.

**Recommendation**: Add `assert_pegged_for<T>(state, clock)` variants that only check the relevant stablecoin. Keep the joint check as the default for batch settlements that may mix types.

---

### L-03 · No pause / circuit breaker
**Severity**: Low
**Status**: Open (architectural)
**Location**: All modules

There is no `paused: bool` field gated by AdminCap that would let operators halt settlements in an incident. The only emergency lever is `peg_monitor::update_peg` with deliberately bad data (which halts all settlements but is hacky).

**Recommendation**: Add `PauseState { paused: bool }` shared object and `assert!(!pause.paused, E_PAUSED)` at the top of every settlement entry function. Gate `set_pause` with `AdminCap`.

---

### L-04 · `business_account::submit_application` uses `#[allow(lint(self_transfer))]`
**Severity**: Low
**Status**: Open (design choice)
**Location**: `move/sources/business_account.move:38-58`

`BusinessAccount` is created and transferred to the caller as an owned object. Owned objects are harder to query in dashboards (need to iterate by address) and don't compose with other shared-object flows.

**Recommendation**: Consider making `BusinessAccount` a shared object with an `owner` field. Easier to query, easier to reference in `settle_payment` without ownership transfer juggling.

---

### L-05 · `receipt_v2` doesn't enforce caller is the actual settler
**Severity**: Low
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/receipt_v2.move:26-53`

Anyone can call `create_receipt` with any data — there's no link back to a real `PaymentSettled` event or a `SettlementPool` reference. Off-chain readers cannot distinguish a real receipt from a forged one without cross-referencing the `tx_digest` to actual chain history.

**Recommendation**: Require either `AdminCap` OR a reference to the settlement pool whose event the receipt is supposed to attest to. Best: emit receipts as part of `settle_payment` rather than as a separate user-facing entry.

---

### L-06 · `peg_monitor::update_peg` lacks monotonic timestamp check
**Severity**: Low
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/peg_monitor.move:59-79`

The function blindly overwrites `last_update_ms` with the current clock. If two PTBs race and the slower one lands second, the chain "remembers" the older timestamp as the latest — which is benign (still fresh) but technically not monotonic. More importantly, an admin replay attack could set the timestamp to an older value... actually no, it always reads from the `Clock`, so this is safe. Mark as informational.

**Recommendation**: Add `assert!(now > state.last_update_ms, E_TIMESTAMP_REGRESSION)` for defense in depth and to catch clock bugs early.

---

### I-01 · Inconsistent `AdminCap` parameter naming
**Severity**: Informational
**Status**: Open
**Location**: cross-module

- `peg_monitor::update_peg` — `_admin: &AdminCap` ✓
- `business_account::verify_business` — `_: &AdminCap`
- `dual_treasury::*` — `cap: &AdminCap` + `let _ = cap;`

Pick one convention (`_admin: &AdminCap` recommended).

---

### I-02 · Mixed module declaration styles
**Severity**: Informational
**Status**: Open
**Location**: cross-module

`settlement`, `business_account`, `peg_monitor`, `dual_treasury` use the short-form `module name;` (newer Move syntax). `smart_treasury`, `payment_intent`, `audit_anchor`, `receipt_v2` use the block form `module name { ... }`. This is a strong signal that the latter four are older or were copy-pasted from scaffold templates — they correlate exactly with the modules carrying the most critical findings.

**Recommendation**: Migrate scaffold modules to short-form once they're properly rewritten.

---

### I-03 · Scaffold vs production status not visible at module level
**Severity**: Informational
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `smart_treasury`, `payment_intent`, `audit_anchor`, `receipt_v2`

These four modules have doc-comments saying "Phase 1 scaffold" but nothing prevents them from being published. There is no compile-time guard preventing accidental mainnet deployment.

**Recommendation**: Add a `#[test_only]` guard until they're hardened, or split them into a `scaffolds/` subdirectory excluded from the production package via `Move.toml`.

---

### I-04 · `peg_monitor::update_peg` doesn't return new state
**Severity**: Informational
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/peg_monitor.move:59-79`

Caller has to read `state` afterwards or parse the emitted event. Minor UX friction for PTB authors.

---

## Permanent Monitoring Checklist

These are the items the security/ops team should **always** keep eyes on. Each has a recommended cadence and alert threshold.

### Hot signals (alert immediately)

| # | Signal | Source | Action |
|---|--------|--------|--------|

### Weekly review

| # | Signal | Action |
|---|--------|--------|
| 8 | `dual_treasury::usdt_age_ms()` for any active buffer > 25 minutes | Investigate why sweep didn't fire |
| 9 | Total `protocol_fees` accrued vs. expected (revenue reconciliation) | Compare against off-chain quote totals |
| 10 | Number of `BusinessVerified` events vs. Sumsub completion rate | Drift = stale verification queue |
| 11 | `PegUpdated.sequence` monotonicity | Gaps suggest dropped operator updates |
| 12 | Settlements aborted vs. settlements succeeded | Trend up = config drift somewhere |

### Quarterly review

| # | Item | Action |

## Closing notes

**Highest-leverage next moves**, in priority order:

1. **Fix C-01, C-02, C-03 before any further work on those modules.** They are scaffolds and won't survive a real audit; pretending otherwise is worse than removing them from the package.
2. **Address H-05** (`init_peg_state` opens a 60s settlement window with zero peg data). One-line fix.
3. **Document AdminCap custody policy** (M-06). If the admin key is on a laptop somewhere, the entire protocol is one phishing email from being unrecoverable.
4. **Wire the abort code 103** into `ABORT_CODES` mapping — already done in this revision. Same pattern for any new abort codes scaffold modules add.
5. **Treat the four scaffold modules as deleted for production purposes** until rewritten. Move them under `move/sources/scaffolds/` and exclude from `Move.toml::[package].sources` until ready.

This report should be re-run after any change to `move/sources/` and committed alongside the change.
