/**
 * ComplianceCap is subtractive BY TYPE. This is the check that keeps it so.
 *
 * The claim on the capability is that holding it lets you make the settlement
 * controls stricter and never looser: you can lower a tolerance, raise a
 * requirement, remove a venue, or halt settlement — and you cannot raise a
 * tolerance, lower a requirement, add a venue, or resume. That is what makes it
 * safe to put in a compliance function's hands rather than the cold multisig's,
 * and what makes a compromise of it a denial-of-service rather than a
 * loosening.
 *
 * A claim like that decays the moment someone adds a convenient setter. So the
 * rule is enforced on the SIGNATURE: every function in splash_core whose
 * parameters include `&ComplianceCap` must be one of a named few, and each of
 * those must still look like the operation it claims to be. Adding a loosening
 * function is then not a subtle diff in a 250-line Move file — it is a failing
 * build that names this script.
 *
 * Run by `npm run lint`.

 * function to make ANY control looser than it was? If yes, it belongs on
