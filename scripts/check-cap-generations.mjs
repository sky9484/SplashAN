/**
 * A revoked capability must not keep working anywhere.
 *
 * Phase 7 made `AnchorCap` and `ComplianceCap` revocable by giving each a
 * generation and holding the live one in a shared `CapRegistry`. That only
 * means something if EVERY function accepting one checks it. A single consumer
 * that forgets is a hole through which a stolen cap keeps signing — and it is
 * the kind of hole found by an incident rather than by a review, because the
 * function works perfectly for the ninety-nine percent of the time nobody has
 * revoked anything.
 *
 * So the rule is checked on the signature and the body together: a function
 * that takes `&AnchorCap` must also take `&CapRegistry` and must call
 * `assert_anchor_cap`. Same for the compliance cap. Capabilities taken BY VALUE
 * are exempt — `destroy_anchor_cap`, `rotate_anchor_cap` and `transfer_cap`
 * consume the object rather than exercise its authority, and a revoked cap
 * being destroyed or handed on is harmless.
 *
 * Run by `npm run lint`.
